<h1 class="entry-title">Call for Proposals</h1>
<p>Student and postdoctoral researchers from the NSF-funded Science of Learning Centers (SLCs) will meet at the Seventh Annual iSLC Student / Postdoctoral Fellow Conference on March 6-8, 2014. During this three-day conference hosted by PSLC, participants will discuss their interests for understanding and improving how people learn in a variety of settings. To this end, participants will share and learn about useful methods for conducting research to achieve these goals.</p>		
<p>The iSLC 2014 conference will be focused on the general theme of "Navigating the Future of the Science of Learning." This theme emphasizes the importance of creating a community of science of learning researchers to build a field that can sustain itself when the NSF centers no longer exist. The conference will focus on bringing students and postdocs together with previous SLC alumni to discuss how the science of learning can be sustained as a interdisciplinary research field. </p>
<p>All invited attendees are encouraged to submit a one-page proposal for a poster or symposia
presentation. All poster proposals will be accepted. Symposia submissions will be reviewed by a
committee of representatives from the six SLCs. If your proposal is not selected for a symposia session, it will automatically be entered as a poster. Proposals are due on 11:59 p.m. EST on <strong style="color: #ff0000;">January 31, 2014</strong>. Email notification of acceptance will be provided by February 15, 2014.</p>
<p><strong>POSTER SUBMISSIONS</strong></br>Posters may represent SLC research in any stage of development: conceptualization, data collection in progress, analysis in progress, completed work, etc.</p>
<p><strong>SYMPOSIA SUBMISSIONS</strong></br>Participants who have research that is in a complete or near-complete stage are encouraged to submit their abstract proposal as a symposium presentation. All research topics representative of work across the SLCs are welcome, although we are particularly interested in submissions relating to the following three topics:</p>
<ul>
    <li>How theoretical frameworks have shaped current research: Presenters will highlight how their work has been informed and shaped by the specific theoretical frameworks developed or used by their center.  One example is the KLI framework of the PSLC that will be elaborated upon.  Participants will be encouraged to submit talks that elaborate on their center’s core strengths and innovation, in more detail than what was briefly presented in the center introductions.</li>
    <li>Collaborative research: This symposium will focus on interdisciplinary collaborations.  In addition to giving a general talk about their research and findings, participants will discuss the benefits and difficulties of interdisciplinary collaborations.  This symposium will feature a discussant, who will comment on the overall experiences the different projects have had.</li>
    <li>Research applications: This symposium will highlight the applications of research in the centers.  This may include in vivo research that takes place in classrooms or other learning environments, or it may simply allow participants to show how their research may be applicable to real-world situations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Symposia will be single track and each presentation will be 20 minutes long (including questions).</p>
<p><strong>WORKSHOP SUBMISSIONS</strong> </br>Student and postdoctoral fellows are invited to submit individual or collaborative proposals to present a workshop. Workshops can be on a variety of topics related to research tools and methods of interest, problems and issues faced in interdisciplinary research, applying science of learning research to informal learning settings, etc. We are particularly interested in workshops that address the conference’s three subgoals of supporting intra-center collaboration, promoting inter-center collaboration, and improving collaboration with the broader community; for example interesting workshops might include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Facilitating collaboration with broader community (such as working with museums)</li>
    <li>Networking & Academic ‘speed dating’</li>
    <li>Workshops on new methodologies and research tools (such as in vivo studies, using HLM, running analysis in R, building cognitive tutors in CTAT)</li> 
    <li>Workshops on how to build within center community</li>
    <li>Creating good powerpoint presentation</li>
    <li>How to effectively communicate research</li>
</ul>
<p>Each workshop will be 30-40 minutes.  Workshops involve active participation by participants rather than a lecture style format. 
Special consideration will be given to proposals that are co-organized by multiple centers and those that will be interesting to a
diverse audience.  If you are interested in leading a workshop please submit a proposal with an abstract, a description of what will
happen and who will benefit from your workshop.  All proposals should be formatted according to the <a href="{% static "website/media/Workshop-Proposal-Template.docx" %}">Workshop Proposal Template</a>.  This is an excellent opportunity to lead a session and add a great line to your CV.  Please submit proposals to <a href="mailto:jamie@temple.edu">Jamie Jirout (jamie at temple.edu)</a> and <a href="mailto:cmaclell@cs.cmu.edu">Chris MacLellan (cmaclell at cs.cmu.edu)</a> by <strong style="#ff0000">January 31, 2014</strong>.</p>
