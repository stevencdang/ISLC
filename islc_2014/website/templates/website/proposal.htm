		<p>student and postdoctoral researchers from the nsf-funded science of learning centers (slcs)<br>
will meet at the sixth annual islc student / postdoctoral fellow conference on february 21-<br>
23, 2013. during this three-day conference hosted by silc, participants will discuss their<br>
interests for understanding and improving how people learn in a variety of settings. to this end,<br>
participants will share and learn about useful methods for conducting research to achieve these<br>
goals.</p>
<address>
<address><span style="font-style: normal;">the islc 2013 conference will be focused on the general theme of "science of learning: &nbsp;past, </span></address>
<address><span style="font-style: normal;">present and future."</span><span style="font-style: normal;">this theme&nbsp;emphasizes the&nbsp;importance&nbsp;of&nbsp;creating a&nbsp;community&nbsp;of science </span></address>
<address><span style="font-style: normal;">of learning researchers to build a field that </span><span style="font-style: normal;">can sustain itself when the nsf centers no longer exist. </span></address>
<address><span style="font-style: normal;">the conference will focus on bringing students and postdocs </span><span style="font-style: normal;">together with previous slc alumni to </span></address>
<address><span style="font-style: normal;">discuss how the science of learning can be sustained as a&nbsp;interdisciplinary&nbsp;research field.</span></address>
<address></address>
<address><span style="font-style: normal;">all invited attendees are encouraged to submit a one-page proposal for a poster or symposia<br>
presentation. all poster proposals will be accepted. symposia submissions will be reviewed by a</span></address>
<address><span style="font-style: normal;">committee of representatives from the six slcs. if your proposal is not selected for a symposia</span></address>
<address><span style="font-style: normal;">session, it will automatically be entered as a poster. all proposals should be formatted according</span></address>
<address><span style="font-style: normal;">to the&nbsp;<a href="http://2012.nsf-islc.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/islc_proposaltemplate.doc">proposal template</a>. proposals are due on 11:59 p.m. pst on saturday,</span></address>
<address><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>october 20, 2012</strong></span>. email notification of acceptance will be provided by thursday, november 15,</span></address>
<address><span style="font-style: normal;">2012.</span></address>
<p></p></address>
<p><strong>poster submissions:</strong> posters may represent slc research in any stage of development:<br>
conceptualization, data collection in progress, analysis in progress, completed work, etc.</p>
<p><strong>symposia submissions:</strong> participants who have research that is in a complete or near-<br>
complete stage are encouraged to submit their abstract proposal as a symposium presentation. all<br>
research topics representative of work across the slcs are welcome, although we are particularly<br>
interested in submissions related to the conference theme and on broadening participation in<br>
the sciences (e.g., designing and researching culturally-responsive curriculum; understanding<br>
multiple pathways into science; add another example here). symposia will be single track and<br>
each presentation will be 20 minutes long (including questions).</p>
<p><strong>workshop submissions:</strong> student and postdoctoral fellows are invited to submit individual<br>
or collaborative proposals to present a workshop. &nbsp;workshops can be on a variety of tops related to research tools and methods of interest, problems and issues faced in&nbsp;interdisciplinary&nbsp;research, applying science of learning research to informal learning settings, etc. &nbsp;each workshop will be 1 hour. &nbsp;successful&nbsp;workshops in the past have had active&nbsp;participation&nbsp;by participants rather than a lecture style format. special consideration will be given to proposals that are co-organized by multiple centers and those that will be interesting to a diverse audience. &nbsp;if you are interested in leading a workshop please submit a proposal with an abstract, a description of what will happen and who will benefit from your workshop. &nbsp;this is an excellent opportunity to lead a session and add a great line to your cv. &nbsp;please submit proposals to ben cipollini (<a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&fs=1&tf=1&to=bcipolli@ucsd.edu" target="_blank">bcipolli@ucsd.edu</a>) and deana scipio (<a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&fs=1&tf=1&to=descipio@uw.edu" target="_blank">descipio@uw.edu</a>)&nbsp;by <strong>october 20, 2012</strong>.</p>
<p>we look forward to seeing you in philadelphia in february!</p>
