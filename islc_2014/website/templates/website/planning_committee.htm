<p>I am a Ph.D. student at the Human-Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, and an associate in the Program for Interdisciplinary Education Research. I hold a Dipl.-Psych. (German equivalent to B.S. and M.S.) from the Albert Ludwigs Universität in Freiburg, Germany, as well as an M.S. in Human-Computer Interaction from Carnegie Mellon University. My&nbsp;graduate work focuses on learning with multiple graphical representations, as they are commonly used in educational materials. Based on experimental studies in real classrooms with over 3,000 students,&nbsp;I have developed an Intelligent Tutoring System for Fractions. The most recent version of the Fractions Tutor is available for free to students and teachers.&nbsp;I use statistical methods such as structural equation modeling, Bayesian knowledge tracing, item response theory models, and hierarchical linear modeling to analyze outcome and process variables of her experiments.</p>

<p>I am interested in what it means to be human. &nbsp;I participate in an interdisciplinary program on human origins (<a href="http://carta.anthropogeny.org/" target="_blank">http://carta.anthropogeny.org/</a>), and am interested in how our personal experience differs from the underlying processing performed by our nervous system. &nbsp;My research focuses on one such difference: the fact that we have two cerebral hemispheres, and that they are different. &nbsp;Where do the differences come from? &nbsp;How do the hemispheres interact? &nbsp;I study these issues in the domain of visual processing, using computational modeling to connect&nbsp;experimental findings in&nbsp;behavior and neuroanatomy. &nbsp;Specifically, I investigate how local connectivity differences in intra-area connections affect the scale (small vs. large) of visual processing.</p>

<p style="font-style: normal;">Steven Weisberg is a graduate student at Temple University where he uses behavioral methods to study the spatial representation of slope and its use in navigation tasks. His projects encompass both real and virtual environments, as well as map reading. He is particularly interested in the malleability of the sensory systems involved in processing slope information; how those systems fail; and how they underlie and enable our cognitive representations. As a learning scientist and&nbsp;psychologist, one of Steven’s primary goals is to promote STEM-relevant skills that rely upon transitioning between representations. One project, built on research on slope representations as a starting point, applies principles of analogical learning to train contour map interpretation.</p>

<address><span style="font-style: normal;">Kinnari graduated from the George Washington University in May 2009 with a degree in Psychology. She is a member of Dr. Thomas Shipley's Lab and her current interests lie in spatial cognition, specifically the role of gesture in geoscience education. She is currently working on a project looking at the difference between how experts and novices gesture when explaining a geologic map. She is also working on a project looking at how gesture can be used in the classroom facilitating learning of the difficult spatial concepts that are covered in the geosciences.</span></address>

<p>Linsey is a 5th year graduate student in Cognitive Psychology at Northwestern University. She is also the SILC student and post-doc leader. Linsey's research explores the role of analogy and comparison in learning, specifically within the STEM disciplines. Her current projects include studies of learning from visual and spatial analogies, comparison and long-term transfer in problem solving, and the unique contributions of comparison and contrast in children's learning of shape categories.</p>
